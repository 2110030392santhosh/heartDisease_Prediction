 
# Heart Disease Prediction Using RandomForestClassifier

This project utilizes the RandomForestClassifier algorithm to predict the likelihood of heart disease occurrence based on various medical attributes.

## Data Analysis

Exploratory data analysis techniques are employed to understand patterns and correlations within the dataset, enhancing prediction accuracy.

## Model Training

The RandomForestClassifier model is trained on labeled medical data to learn patterns indicative of heart disease presence.

## Evaluation Metrics

Model performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to ensure robustness and reliability.

## Healthcare Insights

This project provides valuable insights for healthcare professionals to assess heart disease risks and support preventive measures effectively.
